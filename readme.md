# Aircraft Sim V 0.1

## Aircraft sim of J10A Using basic aircraft physics by gasgiant on github.

### This sim is meant to recreate the flight performance of aircraft such as the J10 A, however this is still an extremely rudimentary and bare bones simulation so is not very realistic and needs much more fine tuning as well as other features.

# CONTROLS
- PITCH - Left Stick Vertical or W/S
- ROLL - Left Stick Horizontal or A/D
- YAW - Triggers or Q/E
- FLAPS TOGGLE - F
- BRAKES TOGGLE - B
- THROTTLE TOGGLE - Space


# Issues
- no self stabilizing 
- not enough pitch
- roll instability
- incorrect acceleration and top speed
- bouncing with landing gear
- no restarts
- no explosions 
- limited size map 
- almost no map objects
- no variation with acceleration based on speed and altitude
- leftwards roll when pitching up
- inability to set center of mass
